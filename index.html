      <h1>The Problem with Vapes</h1>

      <div id="box-3">
        <p>
          E-cigarette and vaporizer companies often push the narrative that their products are healthier than combustible cigarettes. However, there are many health problems caused by vaporizers, and the products have created a new generation of
          nicotine consumers.

            E-cigarettes and vapes use a battery to heat up a liquid into an aerosol that users inhale. The "e-juice" that fills the cartridges usually contains; nicotine, a chemical that causes addiction; metals like tin, nickel and lead; benzene,
            a
            compound found in car exhaust; and a long list of other toxic chemicals. Vapes also contain diacetyl, which has been linked to the condition known as popcorn lung -- the scarring of lung tissue.

            Though vapes are often marketed as a substitute to traditional smokers, many vapers are first-time users in middle and high school. From 2017 to 2018, the percentage of high schoolers who vaped in the last month more than doubled from 11%
            to
            27.5%

            Combustible products tend to offer flavors such as menthol and maybe grape or cherry when it comes to cigarillos. Popular vape flavors include
            gummi bear, banana nut bread, blue slushie and lemon tart. To combat the wave on new, younger nicotine users, the Food and Drug Administration banned vapes that are flavored like fruit, desserts and mint at the start of 2020.

            Vape users are more likely to become infected with the COVID-19 virus, which also damages the lungs. Researchers at Stanford Medical School found that in teens and young adults
            those who vaped were five to seven times more likely to be infected than those who did not use e-cigarettes.
